        <h1>Unit 1</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Absolute Value</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: the concept of absolute value is new for most students. Focus on knowing the properties of
            absolute value functions, and how to sketch them. On a unit test, teachers often test your knowledge on
            absolute value through 1) evaluate questions (2 marks) 2) solving for variable questions (4 marks) and 3)
            graphing questions (5-7 marks). Make sure to follow your teacher’s requirements for solution formatting;
            don’t lose any marks for incorrect formatting.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 3: Properties of Graphs of Functions. </h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this is a key chapter of unit one. Most test questions revolve around the properties of
            different kinds of functions. On the unit, you may be asked to 1) state certain characteristics of a
            function or 2) sketch a function based on given properties. These combo questions are worth at least 4
            marks. Make sure to spend more time reviewing the properties of different functions.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 4: Transformations</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this chapter covers the test questions that are worth the most number of marks. A combo
            question from this chapter not only tests your knowledge on the transformation of the functions, but also
            their properties and graphs. Questions from this chapter may be worth at least 5 marks. If you are asked to
            state the transformations of a certain function, we recommend you to highlight/underline each element of the
            function so you don’t miss a transformation. You can also look at the number of marks this question is
            worth; usually, the number of marks indicates the number of transformations this function has. Also, make
            sure to follow the correct formatting for the mapping rule.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 5: Inverse Relations</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this is a relatively easy concept in this unit; questions from this chapter are usually being
            tested in context of a combo question. Make sure to be ready to graph a function and its inverse on the same
            cartesian plane (4 marks); make sure to be ready to describe the properties of inverse functions for
            communication questions (2 - 3 marks).
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 6: Piecewise Functions</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this is the last major concept in unit one. Piecewise function questions test your knowledge
            on properties, graphing, and algebra. Focus more on the word problems and algebra questions from this
            chapter; they are the most frequently asked questions and are worth 3 - 5 marks.
