        <h1>Course Overview:</h1>
        <br>

        <p>
            MHF4U (Advanced Functions) is the prerequisite for MCV4U (Calculus and Vectors). It looks in-depth at
            functions and their characteristics, including: Polynomial functions, Absolute Value Functions, Rational
            Functions, Trigonometric Functions, Exponential/logarithmic functions, and combinations of these functions.
            This course also briefly introduces the concept of rates of change, the fundamental concept that leads into
            calculus.

            General Studying Tips: PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS. This is a course where there are lots of small details
            behind each key concept. Generally, listening in class, taking notes and doing homework are the bare minimum
            work; students are highly recommended to devise a specific summary for each unit that is tailored to his/her
            needs. Students are recommended to focus on doing questions that 1) are worth more marks and 2) questions
            they often make mistakes on. While doing an assessment, it is recommended that students check over their
            work as many times as possible, specifically for details such as: transcription error, +/- signs, and
            teacherâ€™s preferred solution formatting (line-up equal signs, therefore statements etc). Specific studying
            tips will be offered under the webpage for each unit.
