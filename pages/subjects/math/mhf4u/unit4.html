        <h2>Chapter 1: Solving Polynomial Equations</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tip: make sure you know the quadratic formula for this chapter. You can choose your preferred way
            of factoring for this unit. This chapter is not as important as the next two chapters and teachers rarely
            test you on this chapter.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 2: Solving Linear/Absolute Value Inequalities</h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tip: this chapter is extremely important. Simple inequality questions may be worth 1-2 marks;
            double inequality questions may be worth 3 marks. Make sure that you know which words/phrases match with
            which inequality sign. Also, make sure to be able to graph/create an inequality function based on a given
            scenario.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 3: Solving Polynomial Inequalities. </h2>


        <p>
            Studying Tips: this is the most important chapter as questions from this chapter are most frequently tested
            and are worth the most number of marks. The interval chart is the key in this chapter. You will need to know
            how to use it for this chapter and the next unit. Straightforward interval chart questions are worth 5
            marks. In addition, pay particular attention to the word problems. We recommend you to always draw a
            reference diagram that illustrates the scenario in a word problem; this will help you determine the correct
            equation to solve for using the interval table. Word problems are usually worth 6 - 7 marks.
