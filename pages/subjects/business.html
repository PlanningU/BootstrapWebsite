        <p data-i18n="business-body">
            There are four grade 12 level business courses offered in the Ontario Curriculum: Accounting (BAT4M),
            Economics (CIA4U), International Business (BBB4M), and Business Leadership (BOH4M). Although business
            courses are not the prerequisite courses for any university programs, it is recommended that students take
            those courses if they are heading into a business program in university. Accounting and economics are the
            two courses that focus on a more specialized content; International Business and Business Leadership focus
            more on the generic understanding of business, case studies, and report writing. Our website provides notes,
            practice tests and studying tips for each course. Feel free to send us an email with any questions and
            feedback you may have regarding the content.
