            Blah In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and
            the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the
            mahajanapadas.[82][83] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which
            became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[84]
            Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting
            the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in
            India.[85][86][87] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an
            ideal,[88] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the
            kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[89] The empire was
            once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now
            thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[90][91] The Mauryan kings are known as much for
            their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism
            and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.
