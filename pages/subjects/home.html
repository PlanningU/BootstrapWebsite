        <p data-i18n="hs-course-body-1">
            Since the majority of university programs only have one or two high school courses as prerequisites, your
            high school schedule will mostly consist of electives. This gives you more freedom to adjust your schedule
            to obtain the highest grades possible prior to applying for universities. Generally speaking, universities
            look at your marks for all the prerequisites and your average in your grade 11 year (should you aim for
            early acceptance). <br>
            Here are some ways for you to obtain a high average in grade 11 and for grade 12 midterm:
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li data-i18n="hs-course-tips-1">In grade 11, take some grade 12 courses that you are certain to get a high mark in. Don’t take too many
                as you have to save those “average boosting courses” for the first semester of grade 12.
            </li >
            <li data-i18n="hs-course-tips-2">Utilize your spare effectively. If you don’t have good courses to take, use your spare time to study for
                the difficult courses you are taking.
            </li >
            <li data-i18n="hs-course-tips-3">Another way to go for early admission is to take all the grade 12 prerequisites in grade 11. Once you
                have all the prerequisites out of the way in grade 11, you can focus on the average boosting courses in
                grade 12 or graduate early.
            </li>
            <li data-i18n="hs-course-tips-4">If your worst subject is English, you can take grade 12 English in summer school. This only works for
                the universities that do not mind you doing this. Some university programs will ‘lower’ your admissions
                average if you take any prerequisites in summer school (ex. Rotman Commerce).
            </li>
        </ul>
