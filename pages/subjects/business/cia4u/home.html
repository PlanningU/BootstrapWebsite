        <h2>Course Overview </h2>
        <br>

        <p>
            Economics is the course that falls between business and social sciences. It helps students develop a basic
            understanding of microeconomics and macroeconomics, from the basic terminologies to understanding how the
            government regulates the economy within a country. For those who are going into a business major, the micro
            and macroeconomics they must take in first year university is built on top of the grade 12 curriculum.

        <h2>General Studying Tips: </h2>


        <p>
            Although the concepts in the grade 12 economics course seem easy, teachers may ask tricky questions on tests
            to elevate the level of difficulty. You have to read the questions carefully before answering them. For all
            the multiple choice questions, there are usually two options that both seem correct; always go for the
            answer that fits closer to your textbook answer. Furthermore, make sure to study in advance and create a
            summary for every unit test; pay closer attention to the small details behind each concept, as you may often
            lose marks on those.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two main ways for teachers to calculate your course mark. The first method is to weigh every unit
            equally. The second method is to weigh each unit differently, but have all tests combined amount to a
            percentage (generally 70%) of your final mark. Regardless, make sure to put in the same amount of effort in
            each unit - do not slack off on units that have less weighting than other units.
        </p>
        <p>
            Certain teachers may also provide assessments in the form of a quiz. Generally, quizzes are worth less than
            a unit test since the material being evaluated is less challenging. Like tests, they are a good opportunity
            to improve your mark.
