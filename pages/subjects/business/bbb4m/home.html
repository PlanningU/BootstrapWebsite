        <h1>Course Overview</h1>
        <br>


        <p>
            This course introduces students to the basic concepts of International Business, from the history of trade
            to current international relations. This course involves a lot of writing. Throughout the course, you will
            be assigned a country to do research on; at the end of every unit, you will apply what you learned in your
            research and write a business report based on your research. For every unit, the test and the business
            report weigh the same. This course is not difficult, just that it has a significant amount of workload.
        </p>
        <p>
            BBB4M is not a prerequisite for any undergraduate programs; however, we recommend you to take this course if
            you are going into a business major, especially if you are going into international business.This course
            refines skill in report writing, presentation, and researching skills that are needed for all business
            programs in university.

        <h2>General Studying Tips:</h2>


        <p>
            The tests are usually very straightforward; they usually consist of MC, fill in the blanks, short answer
            questions, and one/two case questions. A unit test can worth up to 75 marks. Although they are lengthy, the
            questions are not tricky and are usually straight from your notes. The only challenging part of a unit test
            is the amount of information you have to memorize. Make sure that you devise a consistent studying routine
            so that you don’t panic the night before the unit test.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of report writing, you have to strictly follow your teacher’s formatting and citation requirements.
            We recommend that you include more content analysis than your teacher’s expectations; in addition, you
            should always check your grammar before submitting (you can get someone to proofread your essay and use
            grammarly). Finally, make sure you thoroughly include course content in your report for higher grades.
