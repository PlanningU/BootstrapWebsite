            students per year. Queens’ Commerce graduates are highly employable; according to Queens’, 98% of its
            commerce program graduates obtain a job within 6 months upon graduation. The supplementary materials you
            need to submit to Queens changes every month, starting in November and ends in February; you have to

        <h2>High School Prerequisites</h2>


        <ol>

            <li>Grade 12 English, Calculus and Vectors, and one other grade 12 level math course

            <li>The cut off top 6 course average is 87%; as long as your average is above this cut off line, they treat
                you indifferently in terms of your academic performance. The admission focuses more on your EC
                involvement instead of your grades.

            <li>They might reject someone with a 98% average and accept someone with an 89% average, simply due to the
                difference between the two applicant’s EC involvement.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Supplementary Application</h2>


        <ol>

            <li>The supplementary application has two parts: Personal Statement of Experience (PSE) and Supplementary
                Essay (SE). The following questions are the real questions from 2019

            <li>Focus on story-telling - why are those experiences important to you? You can refer to the STAR
                framework: situation, task, action, result.

            <li>Be concise with your essays; you are trying to reveal the most of yourself with the least number of
                words. Stick close to the word limit.

            <li>PSE Questions:
                <ol>

                    <li>Reflect on a time when you were treated unfairly and what that experience taught you (maximum

                    <li>What makes you unique? (maximum 2000 characters with spaces)

                    <li>Tell us a story that illustrates who you are.

                    <li>Reflect on something you wish had been different about your high school experience and why.

                    <li>Describe an experience that influenced the person you are today. "You Belong". Reflect on what
                        this means to you.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                        words, or fewer, describe the impact of this experience and the greatest learning outcome for
                        you.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
