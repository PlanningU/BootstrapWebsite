About Us,"PlanningU is a website that aims to provide valuable advice to those who are applying to a Canadian University. The website will provide guidance for transitioning from high school to university as well as vital course information for several key subjects. Written in both Chinese and English, the website will be accessible to both English and Chinese speaking students (particularly those that live in China).",Why Did We Start PlanningU?,"The idea of a university planning ‘encyclopedia’ originated in mid-June when the PlanningU team had just finished high school and were working on the university-related business. Regardless of the university, every member of the team had great difficulties in navigating the university websites. From tuition fees to course selection, we felt that the resources were scattered across multiple websites rather than being in one consolidated place. Our frustration was further exacerbated by the flood of updates caused by Covid-19.\n","The feeling of searching for a needle in a haystack reminded us of a similar experience that occurred last September 2019. During the first few months of the school year, we underwent a similar experience when applying for university. Even before filling out the application, we were frustrated by the little information surrounding each program and the daunting amount of courses found in each. When it came to filling out the supplementary applications, very little to no expectations or criteria were listed.\n","Now that we have completed these ordeals, we wish that no one has to relive the frustration and angst we went through. Through PlanningU, we aim to streamline the university application process for both domestic and international students by providing free, open resources to help them stay on track during the transition from high school to university. Therefore, PlanningU will bring the most up to date, the most comprehensive information to students, just as our slogan says: Planning for Uni, Planning for U.\n",Some of the universities we provide coverage for include:\n,The University of Toronto\n,The University of Waterloo,The University of Western Ontario,Going International,We hold a global vision: not only to help Canadian students but also students coming into Canada. We value user experience and strive to take the initiative and responsibility to help high school students step with the right foot into university with content that would otherwise be behind paywalls.\n,Queens University,Ontario College of Art & Design University (OCAD),Our Team,Isaac Dong will be enrolled in the Ivey Business Program at the University of Western Ontario. He has valuable experience in organization and business.,See Full Profile,Sabrina is a person. She is good at table tennis.,Isaac Dong,"Western University, Economics + Ivey AEO Status",Notable Achievements,High School Business Club Founder & CEO,Co-Founder of the High School Math Team,Winner of the National Capital Secondary School Athletic Association Competition - Team Division,Three years of experience as a peer tutor,SHAD Western Best Prototype Award,Sabrina Chen,"University of Toronto, Math and Physical Science",University of Toronto,Computer Science,Brief Intro to the Program,High School Prerequisites,Supplementary Application,Extracurricular Involvement Recommendations,"Computer science at the University of Toronto is a popular major. Computer science is a very well-paying career, and the University of Toronto is one of the top universities to offer such a program. Note that acceptance into the CS program does not guarantee a CS diploma after 4 years (5 with optional PEY coop), but rather, after first year, one must meet the requirements and declare a Program of Study (PoSt). This makes the program rather easy to get accepted into but hard to complete.","English 4U, Calculus 4U (and by extension, Advanced Functions 4U)",The University of Toronto looks at your overall average for admissions purposes. This means all 4U/M courses you have taken. An average of at least 90% is necessary to be competitive; one should aim for 95% and above to stay safe.,Answer 4 questions in under 120 words. Examples include:,The Arts and Sciences faculty only looks at your grades and does not take extracurriculars into consideration. ,Rotman Commerce,"Rotman Commerce at the U of T does not have an as competitive entry requirement as Ivey or Queens Commerce. However, the supplementary materials you have to submit for Rotman is rather different than Ivey or Queens. Like other programs at U of T, it is easier to get into Rotman Commerce than graduating from it.","Grade 12 English, Calculus, and one other math course","Your grades are very important for a U of T admissions officer. We recommend that you maintain at least 90% to be competitive. Higher the grades you have, higher the chance you will receive earlier acceptance.","Do not take any prerequisite courses in summer school as Rotman may penalize you for an admission average reduction.

","The entire supplementary material is in the form of a “semi-live” interview. You will be required to stream video responses and answer written questions, mostly on the spot.",The Process is as follows:,Video response: introduce who you are and one thing you are passionate about. The length of the video should be 45 seconds or less,Written responses: describe some of the extracurricular activities you are involved in in 150 words or less,"Written Response: identify a news article you read in the past three days, and describe what you learned from it? 200 words",Written Response: what impact does technology bring about to the business world? 200 words,Video response: Whose responsibility is it to address the issue of climate change? The government’s or the businesses’? You have 45 seconds to prepare and 1 minute to respond,"Rotman focuses more on your marks instead of your EC involvement. However, we still recommend you to be ready to talk about some great accomplishments you had for the interview:",A leadership position in large community organizations,Show that you are persistent with your involvements; admissions officers like to to see dedication and consistent effort.,Take initiatives in founding new clubs and organizations etc. It can be within your school or in the community.,Focus on business related involvement. Make sure you have quantifiable metrics for success.,Work experience also contributes to your application.,University of Waterloo,UWaterloo Computer Science,"The computer science program at the University of Waterloo is one of the most renowned in North America. It is a rigorous 4 years of study, with the coop option adding an additional year of coop experience. Being so renowned, competition is high for a spot in the program. Especially for the year 2021, it is predicted that less students than usual will be accepted to make up for the 200% over acceptance in 2020.",Ontario students: six Grade 12 U and/or M courses including,Advanced Functions,Calculus and Vectors,Any Grade 12 U English,One other 4U course,"Recommended: Grade 11 U Introduction to Computer Science

",Admissions averages start from low 90s. In practice an average over 95 is needed to stay competitive. Make sure to not take these courses in summer school or night school as that is penalized by an admissions average reduction.,"The only supplementary application is the AIF (Admissions Information Form). This is valued quite highly in the admissions process. The AIF will ask you to state your extracurricular involvement, class grades, contest scores, and write essay responses. The AIF will be scored by numerous judges, and given a score from 1 to 5 based on how well it is written and what is written on it. This will be added to your admissions average to rank you among other applicants.

",The AIF will consist of:,Reasons for choosing your program and Waterloo,"Please tell us about your educational goals, your interest in your chosen program(s), and your reasons for applying to the University of Waterloo. If you have applied to more than one program please discuss your interest in each program. (900 character limit)",List your extracurricular activities.,List your employment history,"List any special achievements, distinctions, and awards",Report any special circumstances that affected your academic record,Report education institutions attended and any prior post-secondary education,Extra space for further elaboration on parts of the AIF,Report courses you took and any special circumstances surrounding them,Your score in Waterloo’s math and computer science contests,"Report any other contests written, math or non-math",Leave the contact information for a math teacher who will be your reference,"For computer science, the AIF is due by February 28. Remember to be honest, use good grammar and sophisticated diction, and to submit it on time.

",Extracurricular involvement is highly important for admissions into the University of Waterloo. Recommended activities:,"Euclid, CSMC and other University of Waterloo math contests. Make sure to participate in at least one of CSMC or Euclid and score high (preferably get into top 25% and get a certificate).
","CCC, ECOO, or other computer science competition. CCC is highly recommended.","Athletics of any kind, preferably winning awards or competitions.","Shad, a summer enrichment program.",Form or join math and computer science teams and clubs at school.,Volunteer or gain employment.,Do computer science projects that you can talk about on the AIF.,University of Western Ontario,Advanced Entry Opportunity (AEO),"Western is known for its HBA program at the Ivey Business School; however, you don’t enter the Ivey Business School until year 3, and you have to meet many challenging requirements in year 1 & 2 to successfully make your way to Ivey . Therefore, Ivey designed the AEO status system to 1) recognize high achieving high school student leaders and 2) grant them the opportunity to enter Ivey with a higher chance and less burden.

",The AEO application is very comprehensive and competitive. You must edit your written work thoroughly before submitting.,"They require a minimum of 90% for top six courses; however, we recommend you to maintain at least 93% and higher to be competitive.","Grade 12 English and two maths. We recommend you taking Calculus and Vectors if you are going into a science, engineering, or business major.",You will have to fill out a page that indicates your enrollment at your high school and in the prerequisite courses,Complete your supplementary essays,Fill out any additional extracurricular activities you are involved in,Essay Topics:,"Select TWO activities that you feel demonstrate your leadership abilities best. Focus your description on elements that demonstrate: leadership, teamwork, initiative, achievement, commitment and breadth. Each description should focus on one activity only. You must add two activities to this section to be able to submit your application.","Character in leadership matters. At Ivey, character is defined as an amalgam of virtues, values and certain traits. Character speaks to who a person is rather than what they are able to do. Some would say the virtues of courage, humility and humanity are equally as important as the virtues of accountability, drive and integrity. Do you think this is true? Relate your answer to your experiences in the activities you've included as part of your application.
","Tips: make your answer personal. The admissions officer wants to see what kind of person you are through your answer. Make sure that your answer is specific, and not holier-than-thou. Make sure that your answer sounds natural; you are doing it for the greater good, not for the sake of the application or your personal benefits. Finally, don’t try to ‘teach’ the admission officers what it means to be a leader.

",Make sure you have at least four significant EC involvements that you play a leadership role within.,"Make sure your EC is diverse: Athletics/arts, school related, volunteering, and other types of competitions you do outside of school.","Be ready to talk about your experiences - any challenges you faced, failure stories you had, and successful accomplishments you earned.","Queens’ Commerce is one of the most competitive undergrad programs to enter in Canada; they only take 500 students per year. Queens’ Commerce graduates are highly employable; according to Queens’, 98% of its commerce program graduates obtain a job within 6 months upon graduation. The supplementary materials you need to submit to Queens changes every month, starting in November and ends in February; you have to complete your supplementary application within a month.

","Grade 12 English, Calculus and Vectors, and one other grade 12 level math course
","The cut off top 6 course average is 87%; as long as your average is above this cut off line, they treat you indifferently in terms of your academic performance. The admission focuses more on your EC involvement instead of your grades.
","They might reject someone with a 98% average and accept someone with an 89% average, simply due to the difference between the two applicant’s EC involvement.
",The supplementary application has two parts: Personal Statement of Experience (PSE) and Supplementary Essay (SE).,"Focus on story-telling - why are those experiences important to you? You can refer to the STAR framework: situation, task, action, result.
","Be concise with your essays; you are trying to reveal the most of yourself with the least number of words. Stick close to the word limit.
","PSE Questions:
","Reflect on a time when you were treated unfairly and what that experience taught you (maximum 2000 characters with spaces).
","What makes you unique? (maximum 2000 characters with spaces)
","Tell us a story that illustrates who you are.

关于我们,搏U是每一位报考加拿大大学学生的制胜法宝。本网站将引导学生从高中升至大学，并通过分享最精确的咨询、最全面的课程辅导、和学长们宝贵的经验全程为您保驾护航。本网站提供中英双语，可服务于更广的受众，尤其是中国学生。,因何创立搏U?,建立一个报考大学的「百科全书」的想法源自搏U团队的队员相继高中毕业并开始准备升大学时，发现每一所大学的网站都无法很直观，很方便地呈现信息。从学费、选课，到奖学金和教授，每一个我们关心的问题都藏在了网站的某个角落，找起来无异于大海捞针。我们认为，有一个好用的平台汇总这一切信息是非常重要的，尤其在今年由于疫情问题各种通知和信息格外的多。,这个感觉不禁让我们想起，去年秋季报考大学时就遇到了同样的事情。那时候有关各个专业、各个大学的信息极难获得，尤其是对于刚刚开始报考的学生来说，找起来非常费劲。同样，填写志愿和写各种入学申请时也并没有很好的攻略来进行辅助。,作为过来人，我们希望我们后面的人可以免于这些繁琐和复杂。通过搏U，我们会让报考大学变得轻松起来。无论你是国内普高、国际学校、还是加高，我们都将提供免费、有用的各种资料、咨询、和经验，以便你更平稳的从高中升到大学。正如我们的口号所说：「搏U搏U，为您搏尤」，我们将为你搏最优质的教育。,我们覆盖的大学包括：,多伦多大学,滑铁卢大学,西安大略大学,走向国际化,我们的志向在远方，希望不仅加拿大本地的学生能够收益，来加拿大留学的学生也能从我们这里得到帮助。因此，我们以最高品质的用户体验为全球带来过渡至大学所需的内容。最重要的一点？我们是完全免费的，没有任何会员或充值。,女王大学,安大略艺术设计学院,董骏安将就读与西安大略大学毅伟商学院。他有丰富的组织经验和商业经验。,陈昱璇是个人。她乒乓球打的很好。,我们的团队,看完整履历,董骏安,西安大略大学，经济学 + 毅伟AEO身份,主要成就,高中商业社创始人和社长,高中数学队创始人之一,国家级首都中学体育联赛团体奖得主,三年为同学课外辅导的经验,SHAD西安大略最佳原型机奖得主,陈昱璇,多伦多大学，数学和实体科学,多伦多大学,计算机科学,专业简介,所需高中课程,辅助(补充)材料,课外活动建议,多伦多大学的计算机科学专业是加拿大大学中数一数二的熱門专业。由于多伦多大学的名气，计算机科学专业无论中外都被认可。要注意的是，被计算机专业录取不代表一定就能继续就读于计算机专业。多伦多大学实行「Program of Study」（PoSt）制度，而在这个制度下，大一結束后会再次考量是否达到進专业的标准。另外，多伦多大学有一个为期18个月的实习时间，不过是可选而非强制的。,12年级英语、微积分（微积分则要求高等函数）,多伦多大学看的是所有12年级U/M级课程的平均分。应保证平均分至少为90分，不然机会非常渺茫。最好能确保平均分高于95分。,回答4个问题（120个词以下）,多伦多大学的 Arts and Sciences faculty 主要是看 12年级 以及11年级的成绩 (早鸟录取)。并没有着重于课外活动的参与。,罗特曼商学院,罗特曼商学院的录取门槛并没有毅伟商学院及史密斯商学院那么高。但是，报考罗特曼商学院所需要上交的辅助材料与上述两所大学大相径庭。与多伦多大学其他专业一样，罗特曼商学院也是宽进严出的。,12年级英语、微积分、和另一个数学课,成绩对于多伦多大学是至关重要的。我们建议至少90分的平均分才能有一定的机会被录取。成绩越高，录取的机会和更早得到录取的机会都会提高。,不要在夏校、夜校等非常规方式修上述课程，因为这可能造成学校对于你的平均分做减分处理。,辅助材料是以面试的形式呈现的。报考生将会现场写作回答问题以及现场录制口述答案。,过程如下,视频回答：用45秒介绍自己和一项你热爱的事。,写作：描述一些你参加的课外活动。回答为150词（英语单词）以下。,写作：说一个三天内看到的新闻报道，并阐述你从中学到了什么。回答为200词（英语单词）以下。,写作：科技如何影响商业环境？回答为200词（英语单词）以下。,视频回答：气候变化问题，应由谁负责？是政府还是企业？回答为一分钟以内，在此前有45秒准备时间。,罗特曼商学院注重成绩大于课外活动。当然，为了帮助到你的面试过程，我们依然建议你准备一些课外活动：,大型社区组织内的领导职位,展现你持之以恒的精神。花时间做好一件事要比遍地开花更加分,在学校或社区内创立一个俱乐部或其他组织。,参加商业类活动。确保对于活动内容和成功与否有明确、具体的指标，列如名次、得分、营业额等。,工作经验也是加分项。,滑铁卢大学,水卢计算机科学,滑铁卢大学的计算机专业是加拿大在北美地区非常热门的本科专业。滑铁卢大学在所有加拿大大学中，提供最优质的实习课程；根据滑铁卢大学官方数据，计算机科学专业本科以及一年实习课程的毕业生就业率接近100%。随着每年报考此专业的学生稳步上升，它的录取门槛也随之变成了所有加拿大大学专业中最高之一。2020年度，滑铁卢大学的计算机专业扩招了超过200%，因此，此专业2021年度的录取率将会骤减。,安大略省学生：六门U/M级课程，并必须包括：,高等函数,微积分,任意4U级英语,任意其他4U级课程,建议上11年级的计算机科学课（ICS3U）,官方声称录取线为平均分90以上。实际上，95分以上才能有机会得到录取。切记不要通过夏校、夜校等非常规地方修上述课程，因为学校可能因此对你的平均分进行减分处理。,唯一的辅助材料是AIF（录取信息表格）。这个是招生环节最重要的材料。AIF会询问你关于课外活动、分数、竞赛成绩等信息，并且需要写短篇回答。AIF会由多名招生官打分，并最终赋予一个从一到五的分数。这个分数会再加到你的平均分里，而这两者之和则被用于将你和其他申请人进行排名。,AIF具体包括：,选择滑铁卢大学的理由：,请告诉我们你的学习目标、你对于你选择的专业的兴趣、和你选择滑铁卢大学的理由。如果申请多个专业请逐一说明。（至多900个字符）,填报你的课外活动。,填报任何工作经验。,阐述任何得到的奖项、荣誉等。,阐述任何可能影响你成绩的特殊情况。,填报先前就读的教育机构和说明是否曾经受过高等教育。,用于更详细阐述AIF任何其他内容的地方。,填报所学过的课程以及这些课是否牵扯任何特殊情况。,你在滑铁卢的各个数学和计算机竞赛的成绩。,申报你参加过的任何其他竞赛（包括数学类或非数学类）。,留一个你的数学老师的联系方式。,计算机专业的AIF要于2月28日前提交。切记不要撒谎、确保语法和拼写正确、并尽量用更高级的写作手法。一定要按时提交。,课外活动对于滑铁卢大学的招生是很重要的。建议的活动有：,欧几里得、CSMC等滑铁卢大学举办的数学竞赛。欧几里得和CSMC至少要参加一个，并一定要确保分数很高（最好能够获得前25%的证书）。,CCC、ECOO等计算机比赛。强烈建议参加CCC。,任何体育，最好拿到名次或奖项。,Shad，加拿大最负盛名的夏令营之一。,创办或参加数学和计算机类的校队或社团。,有充足的义工或工作经验。,参与任何与计算机科学相关的项目以及课外活动，以便回答AIF的问题,西安大略大学,预先进入机会（AEO）,西安大略大学因毅伟商学院的HBA专业而闻名。毅伟商学院是大三才进入的，而大一和大二需要满足很多有挑战性的要求才能最终顺利进入。所以，毅伟设计了一个预录取的机会，让在高中就展现领导力和学习能力的学生有一个提前进毅伟商学院的机会。,AEO的申请材料很全面，而且招生竞争非常大。上交的材料务必要反复雕琢。,官方声称最高的六门课的平均分应大于90分，不过我们建议至少要93分的平均分才有一定的机会被录取。,12年级英语和两个数学。对于想学商业、科学、或工程的学生建议选微积分。,需要填写你所就读的高中和所需高中课程。,完成辅助(补充)作文。,填写你参加的其他课外活动。,作文题目：,挑选两个最能体现你领导力的活动。着重描述领导能力、合作、积极性、成就、参与度、和全面性。每一张论文应仅叙述一个活动。此处必须填写两个活动才能顺利提交材料。,作为领导者，品性很重要。毅伟商学院认为，品性是价值观、道德、和各种优良品质的综合体。相比于一个人能做什么，品性更能定义一个人。有些人会说，勇气、中庸、和人性与责任、干劲、和诚信一样重要。你觉得这样说恰当么？请引用你自己的各种经历来证实你的论述。,提示：尽可能的把作文变得很贴近自己。招生官希望通过你的回答知道你是什么样的人。确保答案很具体而不是空泛。确保答案听着很真实，并且不展露任何功利性。最后，不要以一个说教的语气写作，招生官不想听你说教他们。,确保你有至少四个拿得出手的，你担任领导职责的课外活动。,确保课外活动范围很广：体育、艺术、校内、义工、比赛等都涉及。,准备好阐述你的各种经历：克服过的困难、失败的经验、成功的故事等。,女王大学商学院是加拿大竞争最激烈的本科专业，每年，只有500个名额。商学院的毕业生很抢手，据女王大学的数据，高达98%的毕业生半年内能够找到工作。招生时所提交的辅助材料每个月都会有变化，并且开始写辅助材料后需在一个月内完成。,12年级英语、微积分、和另一个数学课,前六门课的平均分应超过87分。只要过了这个分数线，所有人都一视同仁。招生时更关注的是你的课外活动。,一个平均分98分的甚至有可能遭拒，而一个89分的人可能被录取，而区别仅仅是由于两人的课外活动不同。,辅助材料包括两部分：个人经历简介 （PSE) 与 论文 （SE),在描述个人经历及撰写论文的时候，切记不要写流水账 - 你要向面试官叙述一段故事以及聊聊每一项课外活对于你的重要性。,由于字数的限制，你的论文一定要写的精简，用最少的字数展现最多的你,2019 个人经历简介真题: 2000字符，含空格,形容你一次被不公平对待的经历，并反思一下你从中学到了什么？,你有哪些独特的特质？,描述一段最能展现你人格的亲身经历。,如果时光倒流，你想让你的高中经历有哪些不同? 为什么？,形容一段对你人生产生深远影响的事件。,附加作文：,用300字，回顾一个你人生中最具意义的课外活动或工作，并讲讲你从中学到了什么。,务必在一个大型社区组织中担任领导角色。,表现你持之以恒的精神。恒心是招生官喜欢看到的一个特质。,一定要展现主动性。建议创办新的社团或队伍。校内或校外的组织皆可。,注重商业性质的活动。确保有明确、可衡量的成功标准。,工作经验对申请有益。,女王大学,女王商学院,大学申请,简介,你是否因报考大学时，不知道学校想看什么而头大？你是否因为要写很多五花八门的辅助材料而感觉身体被掏空？当招生标准像火箭一样往上涨时，仅仅做到门槛的要求是远远不够的。不过，不要怕，本网站会为你解析报考大学所需的一切情报。,搏U将带来各种使用的写辅助材料的技巧。这些包括：,专业的概括。,所需的高中课。,辅助材料的真题。,课外活动的指导和建议。,如果你有任何问题或意见，欢迎你在网页下方的邮件地址或通过微博私信联系我们。,搏U,主页,关于我们,高中课程须知,数学,商科,申请大学,概述,滑铁卢大学,计算机科学,多伦多大学,计算机科学,罗特曼商学院,西安大略大学,AEO预录取身份,女王大学,史密斯商学院,大学申请须知,To-Translate,你的归属 - 这四个字对你来讲代表什么？,确保你的答案涵盖所有题目中所提到的特质。我们建议你在写草稿的时候，标记出来哪些课外活动对应哪些特质。,ENG4U,MCV4U (以及 MHF4U),你是如何克服困难,你有没有面对歧视,你有兴趣的社团/体育活动,*注意：这些问题是可变换的,过程如下:
