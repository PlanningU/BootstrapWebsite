<h2 data-i18n="about-mission-heading">Our Mission</h2>
<p data-i18n="about-mission-body">To provide a free, open resource for those who dream of going to university.</p>
<h2 data-i18n="about-why-create">Why Did We Start PlanningU?</h2>
<p data-i18n="about-create-body-1">
    Here at PlanningU, we fondly remember our Grade 12 year. Or rather, we remember the stress, frustration, and
    confusion that we experienced when writing our university applications. Regardless of the university, every member
    of the team had great difficulties in finding what universities were looking for in their applications. From writing
    essays to online interviews, we were sick of seeing broad, meaningless advice in the form of “Just Be Yourself!” -
    we wanted solid, concrete, examples. <br>
    Now that we have gone through these experiences ourselves, we wish that no one has to relive the frustration we went
    through. Through PlanningU, we aim to streamline the university application process for both domestic and
    international students by providing free, open resources to help them stay on track during the transition from high
    school to university.<br>
    We know how important your Grade 12 year is to you. That’s why we are providing free notes, quizzes, practice tests,
    and study guides for several of the most competitive subjects in Ontario to help you gain a competitive edge in
    class.<br>
    We’re also providing detailed advice for applying to several of Canada’s top universities and their most popular
    programs, including:
